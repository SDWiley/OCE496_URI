%\section{Software Design}
The software design controls the timing and data collection for the
package. The software structure is simple, yet crucial. In order to
keep the data collected by the package relevant, the software
logic and timing needed to be in order. \\

The first state in the software design is the initialization state.
Here, the analog to digital converter was initialized through I2C
communication. The handle of the analog to digital communication
object was saved for later use in the next state. Once the
initialization state was finished, the application proceeded
to the sampling state.\\

In this application, 200 Hz was decided to be the target sampling
rate. The program waited for an interrupt then the system time 
has reached a user-defined time. This is important because every 
sensor package waited for the same time and they sampled  
at the same instant (accurate to a millisecond). When the signal was received, 
the application proceeded to collect data from the peripheral sensors. For
each sample during the sampling duration, data was collected
from the ADC via I2C. The data structure was appended over the sampling entire
sampling period and passed as a return from the state.
Once the sampling duration was over, the data logging
state was begun. \\

The data logging state received the data structure created in the
previous sampling state. This data was then sorted and written to a
standard comma delimited text file. The file stream was closed
once all of the data had been written and the program finishes. A
simple block diagram of this flow can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:PRO_SoftFlow}.
