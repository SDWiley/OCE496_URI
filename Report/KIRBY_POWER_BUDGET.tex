\section{Power Budget}
\indent After analyzing the power consumption of the individual components of the sensor package, the following power budget was formed (Table
\ref{tab:Power_Budget}). Note that there was a $+10\%$ allocation added to the total power calculated. This was to account for any errors in calculation or
any miscellaneous items that were looked over. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Component}                                          & \textbf{Power Consumption (mW)} \\ \hline
$\mu$ Processor                                      & 1500                   \\ \hline
ADC                                                & 0.66                   \\ \hline
GPS                                                & 132                    \\ \hline
Wireless Transmitter (Anticipated)                 & 800                    \\ \hline
Strain Gauge                                       & 95                     \\ \hline
Accelerometer                                      & 1.4                    \\ \hline
Total                                    & $\approx2530$          \\ \hline
\textbf{Approximate Total Power Consumption +10\%} & \boldmath{$\approx2800$} \\ \hline
