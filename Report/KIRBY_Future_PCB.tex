\subsubsection{Fabrication of Printed Circuit Board}
The printed circuit board (PCB) described in Section \label{sec:PCB} was not sent out to be fabricated and "stuffed".
This was because of an incomplete board layout.
Although all of the component footprints were created for the board, not all traces were laid.
Since a board was not fabricated, it should be noted that some additions to the board would make it complete.

\paragraph{PCB Additions}
The following items should be added to the next revision of the PCB:
\begin{itemize}
\item XBee Pro S3B Wireless Receiver
\item Surface-Mount Passive Components
\item Breakout Pins
\item Debugging Items
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{XBee Pro S3B Wireless Receiver}
The XBee Pro S3B Wireless Receiver (or equivalent) needs to be added to the board in order to transmit data to the base station. 
The wireless module was not integrated into the initial design of the PCB due to inability to interface with the unit.
As mentioned in \ref{sec:XBeeFuture}, work needs to be focused on functionality of the wireless data transmission system.
\subparagraph{Surface-Mount Passive Components}
For the initial design of the PCB, standard through-hole passive components were used for the basic circuits; resistors, capacitors, \textit{etc}.
This was done so that it would be possible to acid-etch a prototype PCB in-house prior to sending the design to a board house.
This proved to not be feasible due to the footprint of the MMA7361 accelerometer being a miniature surface mount component (LGA14 package).
