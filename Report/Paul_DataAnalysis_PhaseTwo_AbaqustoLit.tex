\subsubsection{Comparision of Developed Abaqus Model with Liturature}


In verifying the results of the model produced in Abaqus experimentl data taken on the Claiborn Pell Bridge that were published in the Journal of the
Structural Division. Upon completion in 1969 a study involving seven seismometers estimated the first 20 modes, 11 normal modal response shapes, and 20
critical damping locations. Traffic, wind, and other environmental factors loading was measured by seismometers. The direct power spectral density by
way of the Ambient Vibrations Survey method was found of each recorded motion, estimates of the natural frequencies were produced. An Ambient Vibration
Survey (ASV) was performed on the bridge on August 20-22, 1969. During experimentation, approximately 8,000 vehicles passed over the bridge each day
and winds were moderate. Seven seismometers were arranges in five different orientations to properly capture the modal shapes. 20 natural
frequencies, 11 normal mode shapes, and 20 critical damping estimates are presented. The First 20 modes of vibration ranged from 0.155-0.993 Hz,
modal shapes for the first 5 symmetric vertical modes can be seen in \ref{fig:Paul_Modes1-5}\\
