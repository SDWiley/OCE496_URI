\subsection{Cell Phone Accelerometer}

An HTC smartphone was used to collect data at various locations throughout the bridge. The Bosch bma150 3-axis accelerometer within the smartphone switches between the 2, 4, or 8 g setting. Figure \ref{fig:threeloc} shows how each channel compares to another in a different location. The three time series are independent of each other and range from 90 to 273 seconds in duration. 

\indent The greatest accelerations are observed in the sample taken at a quarter of the length of the main span. At mid span there is a noticeable amount of acceleration but it decays to a small value around 80 seconds. The data set taken in the computer room is barely noticeable in comparison to the other two locations.

\indent The data was low pass filtered with a Chebychev Type-II filter with a 5 Hz cutoff. It will not distort the frequencies we are expecting on the order of 1 Hz or less. Using a peak picking technique, the average frequency of the dominate vibration is 16 Hz. These points were observed in the x and y, lateral channels at midspan.
