%\subsubsection{Wireless Data Transmission}
The XBee Pro S3B long-range RF module was chosen wireless communication between the sensor package and the base station.
The unit was chosen due to its high range, up to 28 miles under ideal conditions, and relatively low power consumption (~800mW).
Unforeseen issues were encountered when interfacing the units using the development board sold by the manufacturer, Digi International Inc.
It was deemed that the task was a low priority in comparison to establishing the time synchronization of the data.
Software was developed to support the RF module when the hardware issue was addressed; however this did not get completed during the project time-frame. 
Future development on this system is a top priority.
