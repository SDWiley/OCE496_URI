\section{Introduction}
The sensor package created this semester is a primitive prototype with
bare functionality with respect to the final product. The final
product sensor package is planned to be an autonomous sensor package
capable of transmitting strain gauge and accelerometer data
wirelessly to a base monitoring station. The package  should also
be synced with other sensors monitoring the same structure so the
base station can collect synchronous data from multiple locations
on the structure. \\

The package that has been developed at this stage of the project does
not have some of the important functionality that the final project
is expected to have. The current prototype has the ability to
collect strain gauge and accelerometer data over a sampling
period at a given sampling rate. The timing of the data
collection was driven by an external clock source. Each sample
is given a timestamp with a GPS device and logged to a file
for manual analysis. At this point in time, multiple packages
were not time synchronized, nor were wireless communications
possible. This current package is quite modular, and has
many important pieces which are detailed in the following
sections.
