\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Phase One (Fall 2013)}
\indent Verified Abaqus software by comparing the natural frequencies for a simply supported beam produced by a computed model with an analytical solution. Designed and assembled a sensor package capable of accurately collecting vibration. Data was collected from the simply supported beam that concurred with results from analytical solution and model. This package was missing three main components; power independence, wireless communication capabilities, and GPS time synchronization.\\
\subsection{Phase Two (Spring 2014)}
\indent Produced a FEM of the Claiborn Pell Bridge to identify locations for sensor packages to be installed based on modal response and to indicate the approximate natural frequencies to expect from bridge. Completed sensor packages, installed them on the bridge in specified locations, and transmitted data that was used to evaluate the natural frequency.\\
