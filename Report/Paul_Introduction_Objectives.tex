\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Phase One (Fall 2013)}
\indent Verify Abaqus software as a viable software package for future modeling by comparing the natural frequencies for a simply supported beam produced by a computed model with the analytical solution. Design and assemble a sensor package capable of accurately collecting vibration data. Collect data from the simply supported beam that concurs with results from analytical solution and model. This package was missing three main components; power independence, wireless communication capabilities, and GPS time synchronization.\\
\subsection{Phase Two (Spring 2014)}
\indent Produce a FEM of the Claiborn Pell Bridge to identify locations for sensor packages installation based on modal response and to indicate the approximate natural frequencies to expect from bridge. Complete sensor packages, install them on the bridge in specified locations, and transmit data for frequency evaluation.\\
