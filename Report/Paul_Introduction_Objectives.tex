This report will discuss the planning process of designing a sensor package intended to evaluate vibration on the Claiborne Pell Bridge. As this is a
two-semester project the preliminary assembly of the package was simplified to evaluate vibrations of a 6.8 meter angle beam in phase one. A finite element
model was produced of this angle beam to provide information on the modes of vibration and natural frequency. In the second semester the package was
further developed but not completed. Data was collected from the top of the towers by the incomplete package. A FEM was produced of the Claiborne Bridge
and used to evaluate approximate natural frequencies of the bridge and to indicate where the package should be installed for best results. \\
