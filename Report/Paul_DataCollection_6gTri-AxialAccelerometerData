\subsubsectin{6g Tri-Axial Accelerometer Data }

\indent Vibration data for the L beam were collected with a microphone, piezoelectric strip, 3g accelerometer to computer, and 6g accelerometer from the sensor package.The only results discussed in this section are those collected from the 6g accelerometer, other results can be viewed in Appendix ()\\
\indent Vibration frequencies of the angle beam were captured by mounting the 6g accelerometer to the beam and striking the beam. The 3” x 3” aluminum angle beam of 3/16 thickness was placed open end down with right angle pointing upward during striking. Configurations varied for supports, strike locations, and accelerometer placement locations. \\
\indent The accelerometer was used to gather vibration data at four different locations. These were at a distance of L/2, L/3, L/4 and L/5 from the angle support, where L is 240” (the length of the supported section of beam).\\
\indent For each accelerometer position, the beam was struck at distance L/8, L/10 and L/16 from the angle support. During the tests using the accelerometers, the beam was struck gently as to minimize or prevent clipping by exceeding accelerometer range of measurement.\\
